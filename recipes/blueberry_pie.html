        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>⅔ cup shortening, chilled</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup caramel sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons cold water</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>⅓ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>4 cups fresh blueberries</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups fresh blackberries</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut shortening into 2 cups flour and salt until the shortening is the size of small peas. Sprinkle in water 1 tablespoon at a time until flour is moistened. Gather into a ball, wrap with plastic, and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. Divide the dough in half and roll out half on a lightly floured board. Line a 9-inch pie dish with the pastry. Roll out the top crust and set aside.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <br>
            <li>Mix sugar, 1/3 cup flour, and cinnamon. Stir in berries to coat. Pour the filling into the pastry-lined pan. Sprinkle with lemon juice and dot with butter. Cover with top crust; cut slits in the top to vent the steam. Seal the crust and flute the edges.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Cover the edges of the crust with foil to prevent over-browning. Bake in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the juices are bubbling, about 45 minutes. Remove foil during the last 12 minutes of baking.</li>
            <br>
        </ol>
